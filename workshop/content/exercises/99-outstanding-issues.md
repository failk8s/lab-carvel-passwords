This completes the tour so far on exploring how the Carvel tools can be used
to deploy applications which require randomized passwords. We aren't done yet
and the workshop will be added to later to explore further how Carvel can be
use for this problem.

Topics which will be covered later will include:

* Using the ``secretgen-controller`` application to generate secrets that can
  be injected into applications.

* Generating hashed password database entries rather than injecting raw
  passwords.
